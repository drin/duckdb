the cmake build uses build options (e.g. `...SUBSTRAIT_NAME`) to dynamically
`add_subdirectory` to the cmake build.

We will try to do a simpler version that uses the same array (`...SUBSTRAIT_NAME=[]`) to
list dependencies that we dynamically depend on in meson. Each string provided in the
array will provide a dependency name that can also be used as a subproject name (first
element in the `fallback` kwarg) and prefix for the target (second element in the
`fallback` kwarg that is "<library>_dep" by convention).
